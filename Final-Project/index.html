  <h3><strong>Groups Trained by Man-United</strong></h3>
  <h4>Fergie's Fledglings</h4>
  <p>
    The Fergie's Fledglings were a group of young football players that were recruited by Manchester United under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Fledglings were trained by assistant coaches Brian Kidd and Eric Harrison until eventually progressing to the 1st team during the 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
    These groups contributed to the FA Cup in 1990 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991.

  <h4>Busby Babes</h4>
  <p>
    The Babes were a group of footballers trained by Manchester United's Chief scout Joe Armstrong and assistant manager Jimmy Murphy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Busby Babes progressed from the club's youth team into the Man-United first team under the management of Matt Busby from the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were notable not only for being young and gifted, but for actually being developed by the club itself, rather than bought from other clubs, which was customary at the time.
